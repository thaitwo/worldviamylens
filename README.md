## Dev Environment

1.  **Run Locally**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

 

## Project Structure

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a [Gatsby project](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-project-structure/).


## Deploy

Once commits are pushed to the ```master``` branch, staging site will auto deploy on Heroku.
